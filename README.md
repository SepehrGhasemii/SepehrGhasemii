Hello everyone.
My name's Sepehr Ghasemi.
I study petroleum engineering at science and research university.
I'm a junior front-end web developer and I love structure and order and also stand for quality. 
Also I like working in a team, Learning in a team is faster and more delicate and that's why I like teamwork.
